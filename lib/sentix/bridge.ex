  Opens a bridged port to `fswatch`, using the provided paths and options.

  We listen on `stdout` from `fswatch` so that we may forward the output to any
  subscribers. In addition, we monitor the port to ensure that any host server
  will crash if the port does, allowing Supervision trees to restart the ports.

  The options available are described in `Sentix.start_link/3`, so please view
  documentation there for further information.
