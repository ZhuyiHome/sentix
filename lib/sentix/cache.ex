  This module just provides a cache interface which can back multiple Sentix
  watchers, to make sure that we have some form of persistence (rather than
  relying on the developer to remember to reconnect on crashes).

  Currently the only provided functions are based around subscriber storage (in
  order to persist across crashes), and paths of binaries to avoid having to look
  for them on every execution.
